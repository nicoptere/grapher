# grapher

a small utility to plot a 2D function in a unit or bi-unit square.
it is meant to quickly test 2D functions in a visual way.


### features
* Math functions & constants (sin, pow, PI etc. )
* allows function nesting ( a = b(x)*c(x) )
* prevents deletion while a nested function in use
* uses local storage
* self contained, no dependencies
* small-ish (could be smaller)
* draggable / resizable window

### todo
* implement GLSL methods
